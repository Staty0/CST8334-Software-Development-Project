## VS code base
if your using vscode please remember set up libraries, launch.json for javafx directory

## Eclipse
I believe eclipse do not need launch.json and setting.json, you can delete that
but need to set up module-info.java
so the javafx will import correctly

## Color
most of colors you can change follow by fx:id at fxml and css file
but since the card background color is design at the beginning so need to change the code 

## Card Stack Color
is located CardStack.java
