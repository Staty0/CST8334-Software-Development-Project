# gui.fxml 
changed the layout and added the Score Number in

# CardDragAndDrop(bottomCardView.setOnDragDone) 
added a simple score system when the card successfully moves

# GUIController
will update the score from ScoreManager

# ScoreManager
This class manages the score for the game.

## VS code base
if your using vscode please remember set up libraries, launch.json for javafx directory

## Eclipse
I believe eclipse do not need launch.json and setting.json, you can delete that but need to set up module-info.java so the javafx will import correctly

## Color
most of colors you can change follow by fx:id at fxml and css file but since the card background color is design at the beginning so need to change the code

## Card Stack Color
is located CardStack.java
